  <h1>Know yourself</h1>
  <p>Gender identity and sexual orientation can be significant parts of who we are. And for many of us, there are lots of other aspects of ourselves that are meaningful and help make us the people we are. All of these identities help shape us into ourselves. Race, ethnicity, (dis)ability, national origin, the language(s) we speak, age, social class, religion/spirituality, and many other identity categories help us tell a larger picture about what it means to be us. Gender identity and sexual orientation can be just one piece of the puzzle. We are all complex human beings, and that is wonderful!</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Gender Identity</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Gender Identity describes our internal understanding and experience of our own gender. Each person’s experience with their gender identity is unique and personal.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Some people think that there are only two gender identities possible: boy or girl. But, in fact, thousands and thousands of people experience their gender outside of this gender binary (binary meaning made up of two things). Some people identify as being both a boy and a girl, or being neither a boy nor a girl. Some folks identity as a gender that is different than boy or girl, or they don’t experience gender at all. Non-binary is a term that refers to people who don’t experience their gender(s) as completely a girl/woman or boy/man.</p>
        <p class="card-text">While many people identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, some people may find that their gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Exploring your gender is normal at all ages and at any stage of life. All of these experiences are equally valid.</p>
        <p class="card-text">You can ask yourself these question:</p>
        <strong>How do I experience my gender?</strong><br>
        <strong>How do I feel in relation to the sex I was assigned at birth?</strong><br>
        <strong>What does gender mean to me?</strong><br>

        <p class="card-text">Gender Expression describes the way in which we present ourselves, which can include physical appearance, clothing, hairstyles, and behavior.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Gender identity is not the same as gender expression. It is important to not assume that the way that someone moves, talks, dresses, or styles their hair is indicative of how they identify their gender. There are an infinite amount of amazing ways to be a person of any gender. Some boys wear dresses, some girls have short hair, and some non-binary folks wear makeup. Gender expression is all about how you want to present. If you are not currently able to express your gender the way that you wish you could, we stand with you. You are still you!</p>
        <p class="card-text">You can ask yourself these question:</p>
        <strong>How do I like to present my gender?</strong><br>
        <strong>In an ideal situation, how would I want to express my gender?</strong><br>
        <strong>What aspects of gender expression make me feel happy and authentically myself?</strong><br>

  <h2>Sexual Orientation</h2>
  <p>Sexual Orientation includes different forms of attraction, behaviors, and identities. For a long time, any people saw all forms of attraction as the same thing. As language has expanded, more and more people have come to understand that different forms of attraction can be parsed out and talked about as distinct categories.</p>
  <p>Sexual, physical, romantic, and emotional attraction are four major ways that people have differentiated forms of desire. While these are the most commonly talked about categories describing attraction, there are other types as well, including mental, sensual, and aesthetic. In our society, it is often assumed that each person is heterosexual (meaning they only are attracted to people of a different gender). It is also assumed that we all experience sexual/physical, romantic, and emotional attraction as the same thing. While some people find that their sexual orientation matches up with these expectations, some folks do not. It is very normal to find ourselves questioning our sexual orientation. Despite what we may have been taught, attraction can look so many amazing, unique ways. Whether you experience all of the categories of attraction as the same, or feel varying amounts of each, or no attraction at all, there are lots of other people out there feeling the same way. You also might experience attraction towards just one gender, multiple genders, or different genders of people at different times in your life. You are never too young or too old to question your sexual orientation. Your sexual orientation is real and legitimate no matter what.

  <h1>What is LGBTQ+</h1>
  <p>LGBTQ+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or sometimes questioning), and others. The "plus" represents other sexual identities including pansexual and Two-Spirit. The first four letters of the acronym have been used since the 1990s, but in recent years there has been an increased awareness of the need to be inclusive of other sexual identities to offer better representation. </p>
  <p>The acronym is used to represent a diverse range of sexualities and gender-identities, referring to anyone who is transgender and/or same/similar gender attracted.</p>

  <p>LGBT and related acronyms have become widely used in recent years. It has also played a role in raising the visibility of marginalized groups, including transgender individuals.</p>
  <p>Research suggests that while attitudes have shifted towards greater acceptance, LGBTQ+ people still face considerable homophobia and discrimination. Harassment, bullying, and workplace discrimination are not uncommon.</p>
  <p>One advantage of utilizing a unified terminology is the ability to engage in political advocacy. Social solidarity can be used to improve visibility, combat discrimination, and advance causes including anti-discrimination and equality laws. </p>
  <p>Unifying terms like LGBTQ+ can help people feel connected to a larger group of people with shared experiences. But the term can sometimes seem to imply that there is a single, homogenous group when there are actually many individual communities made up of diverse individuals. These communities has some things in common, but each identity has its own unique experiences and needs.</p>

   Absolutely not! A person doesn’t need to have a physical experience with someone else to understand who they’re attracted to. In fact, sexual orientation describes way more than physical attraction – it includes our romantic, emotional, mental, and/or spiritual attraction to other people, too. Think about the crushes you’ve had, and who you fantasize about being with: girls, boys, both, or maybe other genders or sexes. Your feelings may or may not change as time goes by and you experience new things, and that is completely okay. Whatever you decide is true for you! No one besides you can decide how you identify.

  Our sexual orientation is actually very different from our gender expression. The first one has to do with who we’re attracted to, and the second has to do with how we express our gender (like being feminine or masculine, or somewhere in between). Although it can sometimes seem like one type of gay person is shown over and over again in the media or on TV, gay people aren’t automatically effeminate, and lesbian women aren’t automatically masculine – in fact, those stereotypes leave out a lot of other personalities and characteristics. Gay and lesbian people are unique individuals, just like everyone else, and can express themselves in an infinite number of ways! There’s no wrong way to be gay or lesbian.

       <div class="accordion-body">
  Actually, you can find gay and lesbian people in all different types of professions! Certain stereotypes offer a limited view on what gay and lesbian people do for work. For example, not all gay men are interested in fashion, theatre, or the arts. Likewise, not all lesbian women are interested in teaching sports, doing construction work, or becoming an athlete. While there may be some jobs that tend to have more gay or lesbian people in them than others, it often has to do with the cultural acceptance they might find in that particular field. Everyone wants to work at an accepting place, and some professions are just ahead of the curve. As society becomes more open and accepting, hopefully people will feel more freedom to follow their interests and explore a wider range of employment possibilities.      </div>

  A person doesn’t need to have a physical experience with someone else to understand who they’re attracted to. In fact, sexual orientation describes way more than physical attraction – it includes our romantic, emotional, mental, and/or spiritual attraction to other people, too. Think about the crushes you’ve had, and who you fantasize about being with: girls, boys, both, or maybe other genders or sexes that don’t fit into the binary. Remember bisexual people do not need to have had equal sexual experiences with both men and women. It’s all up to how you feel – and if identifying as bisexual sounds right to you, then go for it!

  A person who is bisexual does not have to be equally attracted to more than one gender identity. In fact, most bisexuals don’t experience attraction in a 50/50 split. It is very common for bisexual people to prefer one gender over another, and some say that this preference changes over time. Some bisexual people feel romantic feelings towards one gender but physical attraction towards other. Only you can identify what you’re feeling. It’s important to remember, though, that there is no rush. Take as much time as you need to determine what makes the most sense for you.

       <p>It is perfectly normal to feel unsure or worried about coming out. The question of whether or not you should come out is one that only you yourself can answer. Coming out has lots of positives; it can let people in your life know about an important part of you, it can help you to feel less alone, meet new friends as well as possibly meet people to date.</p>
       <p>There are some questions that you could ask yourself when deciding whether to come out. If you do decide to come out, who would be the first person you would come out to? What would be the best case scenario for coming out? What would be the worst? Is there a possibility that things may go wrong if you come out and, if there is a chance, do you have a back-up plan? If there is a chance that coming out may put you at any sort of risk or endanger your ability to continue living at home, you may want to wait to come out until you are more independent.</p>
       <p>Remember, it is your choice to come out and you do not have to come out to everybody in your life at once. You can choose who you want to come out to and when. You can also choose not to come out to certain people in your life. The choice is completely yours. Trevor supports you no matter what. </p>

  It’s great that you’re considering your options, and want to work out a plan that will help you get to the place where you want to be. It sounds like you have a very good idea of what you’re looking for, and what you hope to get out of hormone replacement therapy. That’s a great first step, because it’s really important to understand what could make you feel more like you.Have you talked to your therapist about any of your questions, including any specific anxieties you’re having about some of these unknowns? A lot of the questions and issues you bring up can be really complicated, especially in terms of the deep and complex ways in which the physical and emotional aspects of all of this are tied together.Have you found and/or talked to a trusted health provider yet? It sounds like you have a lot of very specific questions about how hormones might affect you physically, and about any unintended side effects HRT might cause. Everyone’s body is different, so a medical professional would be the best person to tell you about what you could expect from HRT, depending on what your dose is and what your personal needs are. If you haven’t yet found a health provider, one option you could try is a website called www.glbtnearme.org, which helps folks find LGBT resources and services in their area. Your therapist might also be able to recommend a trans-friendly physician in your area who can better answer your questions.If you have been considering getting hormones from a non-professional source, or if consulting with a doctor is not an option for you, we would encourage you research trusted sources before putting anything into your body. Most medical professionals strongly advise against taking any kind of medication that isn’t prescribed because it can be very dangerous, especially since the source and quality of the drugs cannot be verified or regulated.

       Lately I’ve had this desire to be a girl. I know I’m not ready for a sex change, but I’m planning to grow out my hair and wear more girly-types of clothes. I’m not sure what my parents would make of it, but I can’t get this off of my mind. Should I go ahead with it?

          <p>If you feel safe and comfortable starting to express your gender in a new way, then that’s your decision – after all, you know you best! Taking small steps, like letting your hair grow longer, and wearing more feminine clothes can help you learn more about your own gender identity. If you love it, great! Then you can consider what other types of girl-ish stuff you might want to do or take on over time. If you decide you don’t love it, that’s also ok! It’s not hard to cut your hair again, or go back to wearing the clothes you wore before. At this point, since you’re not looking into any medical changes, no decision you make needs to be permanent. There are no laws about how girly or boyish anyone needs to be, regardless of what their body looks like, or what others might think they are supposed to do or look like.</p>
          <p>You might want to think about how your classmates or teachers might react at school. Do you think you would put yourself in danger if you started expressing your gender differently? Are there LGBTQ-affirming student groups who can offer you support? These are just two questions you might want to consider before coming out at school.</p>
          <p>As for your parents, have you mentioned these ideas to them before? Are you worried at all that changing your hair or clothes might put you into an unsafe situation with them? Or, do you think that they might find the change surprising? If you want a resource that will help you weigh the pros and cons of coming out to your parents, or at school, The Trevor Project has a great resource called “Coming Out As You” available at TheTrevorProject.org/YOU. Above all, it’s up to you and your comfort level – no one can make you come out if you’re not ready.</p>

          <p>First of all, it was a big step for you to tell your mom that you think you’re trans. Sometimes our parents and friends need some time to really absorb and understand what we’ve shared. Just like you had your own process for discovering your identity, they need to figure out how they feel, too. It sounds like some of the doubts your mom is expressing have started to creep into your own thinking around who you are, which can be difficult, especially if you value her opinion. For now, let’s focus on YOUR feelings and thoughts.</p>
          <p>Coming out is a very personal decision and you don’t have to tell other people about being trans if you don’t want to. However, it also sounds like you’re worried about other people’s reactions and wonder if it’s worth it to ask them to use your preferred name and pronouns.</p>
          <p>If or when you do decide to come out as trans, you don’t have to do it all at once. It is totally up to you who, when, and how to come out, and it can even be a slow, step-by-step process.</p>

  Yes, it is completely normal to not feel sexual attraction towards other people. Love doesn’t have to equal sex! You can have strong, meaningful relationships with friends or partners that don’t necessarily involve a sexual connection. In fact, there is a huge spectrum of identities and sexualities out there that can help describe different kinds of attraction. We encourage you to learn more about identities like asexuality, which may help you feel more at ease about not feeling sexually attracted to others. Remember, nothing is set in stone, and you don’t have to label yourself with a term unless you’re ready. Your feelings may or may not change over time, and that is completely okay!      </div>

     <div id="collapse2" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
       <div class="accordion-body">
       <p>Not necessarily. There are a lot of things that make up our identity, and who we are physically and romantically attracted to can be discovered over time in many different ways. It sounds like you are listening to yourself and are in touch with your feelings – that’s an awesome first step! What you experienced is perfectly normal, even though being grossed out by your first kiss might have been confusing.</p>
       <p>People who identify as asexual experience little or no sexual attraction to others. Asexual people, or “aces,” often identify somewhere on a spectrum that includes their emotional, spiritual and romantic attraction to other people.</p>
       <p>It might be helpful to think about how you feel about your boyfriend, too. How do you feel about him romantically, spiritually, and emotionally? Remember, love does not automatically equal sex or being physical. In fact, there are many happy, healthy relationships that don’t involve those things.</p>
       <p>So, are you asexual? That’s up to you to decide, because you know yourself best! You might do some more research and find out that “asexual” is a good way to describe yourself – or, you may find another term that fits your feelings better. Give yourself time and space to explore what you are feeling. You are not alone!</p>

       <p>It sounds like you are honestly and bravely sharing your feelings with the people you love and depend on, but that they aren’t hearing, understanding or validating you. That’s really tough, especially because having the support of family and friends can make such a huge difference as we’re discovering who we are. We want you to know that being asexual is completely valid and normal, and that you have our full support!</p>
       <p>It might help to explain to the people in your life that asexuality is a sexual orientation just like being bi, gay, lesbian, pan, or straight – it all comes down to how you are attracted to other people, in what ways. Remind them that you can have strong, meaningful relationships with friends or partners, even if you aren’t being physical with them. You can also try and connect them with some resources, like the ones at the bottom of this page, so they can do some research on their own.</p>
       <p>Ultimately, we can’t change how other people respond to us, or force them to understand who we are. What we can do is share our stories and make meaningful connections with others who are ready to accept us for who we are. You are an amazing gift to the world, and we are so happy that you are being authentically YOU!</p>
